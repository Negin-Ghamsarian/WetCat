# WetCat: Enabling Automated Skill Assessment in Wet-Lab Cataract Surgery Videos

Dataset release for **"WetCat: Enabling Automated Skill Assessment in Wet-Lab Cataract Surgery Videos"** accepted at ACM MM 2025.

## Overview

The **WetCat** dataset is the first publicly available dataset of wet-lab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises **60 high-resolution recordings** of cataract procedures performed by trainee ophthalmologists on artificial eyes (OKULO-ONE DIMS model) using the **Haag-Streit OSTC microscope system** during 2024-2025. 

Unlike existing datasets derived from real patient surgeries, WetCat provides a controlled training environment that enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical skill metrics such as GRASIS and OSCAR. The dataset focuses on the critical phases of **capsulorhexis** and **phacoemulsification**, which are essential to cataract surgery training.

Each video captures the complete surgical workflow with an average duration of **794 seconds** (standard deviation: 509 seconds), recorded at **1920×1080 resolution** and **30 fps**.

## Dataset Components

### 1. Phase Annotations

All 60 videos are comprehensively annotated with frame-level surgical phase labels, segmented into four distinct phases:

- **Capsulorhexis (Rhexis)**: The precision-critical step of creating a circular opening in the anterior capsule
- **Phacoemulsification (Phaco.)**: The lens fragmentation and removal phase
- **Idle**: Transition periods between phases when instruments are being changed
- **Rest**: Other surgical phases

### 2. Semantic Segmentation Annotations

The dataset includes dense **pixel-level semantic segmentations** for **1,469 selected frames**, encompassing key anatomical structures and surgical instruments critical for skill assessment:

## Skill Assessment Framework

WetCat enables objective, automated skill assessment aligned with established clinical frameworks (GRASIS, OSCAR). The annotations support evaluation of the following metrics:

![Skill Assessment Framework](figures/framework.png)
*Figure 6: Overall framework for skill assessment in wet-lab cataract surgery using phase recognition and semantic segmentation.*

### Capsulorhexis Assessment Metrics

- **Roundness**: Measured by circularity ratio (area vs. perimeter squared)
- **Centration**: Euclidean distance between capsulorhexis and limbus centers, normalized by limbus radius
- **Diameter**: Compared against clinically ideal range of 4.5–5.5 mm
- **Smoothness**: Edge continuity evaluated using curvature-based or Fourier descriptors
- **Precision Benchmarking**: Dice Score and Jaccard Index comparison with ideal reference regions

### Phacoemulsification Assessment Metrics

- **Eye Stability**: Limbus center tracking throughout the phase, with deviations within ±10% considered acceptable
- **Phacoemulsification Duration**: Total time compared against clinical benchmarks
- **Non-Dominant Hand Instrument Analysis**: Movement frequency, amplitude, and trajectory regularity assessment

---

## Anatomical Calibration

For scale normalization and anatomical measurements, the dataset uses specifications from the **OKULO-ONE DIMS artificial eye model**:

- **Limbus diameter**: 11.9 mm
- **Pupil diameter**: 8.5 mm
- **Lens diameter**: 10 mm
- **Anterior chamber depth (ACD)**: 3.75 mm
- **Lens thickness**: ~3.87 mm (under standard intraocular pressure)
